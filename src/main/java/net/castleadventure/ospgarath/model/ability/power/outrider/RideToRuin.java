For every space that were you able to move towards it before attacking, you get a +1 bonus to your attack roll. Upon a successful attack, make 2 additional damage rolls, even if your melee attack was not one that causes damage. This does provoke free attacks, but the damage does not take effect until the end of your turn (Movement and Standard Action/1 time per game).";
