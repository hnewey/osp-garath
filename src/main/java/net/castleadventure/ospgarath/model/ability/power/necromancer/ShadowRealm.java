        description = "When one of your teammates is killed in combat, you may revive them as a wraith or wight from an adjacent space, if the character is willing. The revived character’s endurance is refilled to a value of 3, and their race now permanently changes to “wraith,” or “wight,” at your discretion.  They retain their abilities and powers as though they had never died. However, they are now a Shadow Servant, and can now only regain endurance points through the necromancer’s Mourning Star power. They must follow any order the necromancer gives if the necromancer succeeds on an I vs L roll against them. Once this roll is failed, the Shadow Servant may ignore that order for the remainder of the game (Standard Action/1 time per game).";
