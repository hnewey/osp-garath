        description = "Anytime one of your player teammates makes a successful attack roll against an enemy and verbally celebrates the roll in any way, you may steal the dice and re-roll it and place it in a cup face down without checking the results. This adds the dice to your dice pool.  Your teammate must then reroll their attack with a different dice and take the new result. The dice you have stolen can, on one of your turns, be used immediately in place of a d20 roll that you dislike, but upon choosing to use it you must accept the results even if they are lower than your original roll. This causes you to lose the stolen dice (Free Action/unlimited).";
